# Web Components

Web components are a set of web platform APIs that allow you to create new custom, reusable, encapsulated HTML tags to use in web pages and web apps. Every major browser supports web components out of the box. It is also possible to use web components with frameworks (such as Svelte or Solid), that we are currently not supporting out of the box.
