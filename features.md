# Features

Cartesius aims to offer a board spectrum of features around location intelligence and analytics, including geocoding, fleet management, geodata management and much more. The basis of all features is a large Database of aggregated Open-Source Geodata from multiple sources to deliver accurate and dense geodata of the whole world. Cartesius delivers not only coordinates, but also full shapes of objects such as buildings and highways. You can take a look at the possible information and data available for locations [here](reference/geo-feature-model.md). If you want to use the features with your data, this is also possible. You can easily add and manage your Geo-Data in the Dashboard or with the API.

<summary>Autocomplete</summary>

Our [Autocomplete feature](features.md#autocomplete) delivers search-as-you-type experience on addresses and places with extensive filter functionality and proximity sorting. This can be used to have a quick and easy way to search on a map or to have an address search for customers in your application.

If you need accurate address data, such as for delivery addresses,[ Form Autocomplete](reference/api/form-autocomplete.md) offers a way to autocomplete addresses. With Form Autocomplete, users can quickly and accurately fill out their address.&#x20;
